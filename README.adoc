A small utility to help manage the destruction of DigitalOcean droplets.

Got a little crazy with *just how easy* creating Droplets on DigitalOcean is?
Added too many 0s to Terraform's count parameter? Don't worry, Sinkship can
help.

Usage
-----
Get the tool:

----
go get github.com/ciarand/sinkship
----

Create a personal access token (PAT) from your
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/tokens/new[DigitalOcean control panel].

[NOTE]
====
Sinkship will read token information from the following locations, in order:

- The CLI flag "-token"

- The environmental variable "DO_TOKEN"

- The file "token" in the current directory
====

Run the tool:
